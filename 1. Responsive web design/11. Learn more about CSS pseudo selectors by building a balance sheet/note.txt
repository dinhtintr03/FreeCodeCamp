The span[class~="classname"] selector will select any span element whose class includes classname.

The CSS clip property is used to define the visible portions of an element. Set the span[class~="sr-only"] selector to have a clip property of rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px).
	clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
	clip-path: inset(50%);

To prevent the text content from overflowing, give your span[class~="sr-only"] selector an overflow property set to hidden and a white-space property set to nowrap.
	overflow: hidden;
  	white-space: nowrap;
	position: absolute;

The :first-of-type pseudo-selector is used to target the first element that matches the selector.

The calc() function is a CSS function that allows you to calculate a value based on other values. For example, you can use it to calculate the width of the viewport minus the margin of an element:

.example {
  margin: 10px;
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}

Before you start diving in to the table itself, your span elements are currently bolded. Create a span:not(.sr-only) selector and give it a font-weight property set to normal.

The :not() pseudo-selector is used to target all elements that do not match the selector - in this case, any of your span elements that do not have the sr-only class. This ensures that your earlier rules for the span[class~="sr-only"] selector are not overwritten.

The key difference between tr[class="total"] and tr.total is that the first will select tr elements where the only class is total. The second will select tr elements where the class includes total.

The :nth-of-type(number) pseudo-selector is used to target specific elements based on their order among siblings of the same type.
