box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;
Here's how the offsetX and offsetY values work:
    both offsetX and offsetY accept number values in px and other CSS units
    a positive offsetX value moves the shadow right and a negative value moves it left
    a positive offsetY value moves the shadow down and a negative value moves it up
    if you want a value of zero (0) for any or both offsetX and offsetY, you don't need to add a unit. Every browser understands that zero means no change.

It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the red color in the center? When designing a site, you can use this effect to draw attention to important headings, buttons, or links.

HSL color model: hue, saturation, lightness

CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number 0 -> 360 for hue, 0->100% for saturation, 0->100% for lightness

saturation and lightness must have % 

Another way to set the opacity for an element is with the alpha channel. Similar to the opacity property, the alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is.
