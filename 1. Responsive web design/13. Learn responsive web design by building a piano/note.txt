The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.

float: ...; left,,..

The content property is used to set or override the content of the element. By default, the pseudo-elements created by the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty, and the elements will not be rendered to the page. Setting the content property to an empty string "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while still being empty.

The @media at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to conditionally apply CSS. Media queries are commonly used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width and min-width properties.

@media (max-width: 960px) {
  .card {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}
