Variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) and are given a name and a value like this: 
	--<variable>-<name>: value;
	ex: --building-color1: #999;

To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on.
	var(--variable-name)

Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:
	gradient-type(
  		color1,
  		color2
	);
Gradients can use as many colors as you want like this:
	gradient-type(
  		color1,
  		color2,
  		color3
	);

	gradient-type(
  		color1,
  		color2 20%,
  		color3
	);

	gradient-type(
		direction,
		color1,
		color2
	);

	radial-gradient
