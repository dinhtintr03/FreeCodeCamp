The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed (as in, when the user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - this means users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load.

CSS Grid offers a two-dimensional grid-based layout, allowing you to center items horizontally and vertically while still retaining control to do things like overlap elements.

display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 94rem 1fr;

row-gap: ...; add space between rows in grid layout

One option is the grid-column property, which is shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. The grid-column property tells the grid item which grid line to start and end at.

Create a .heading rule and set the grid-column property to 2 / 3. This will tell the .heading element to start at grid line 2 and end at grid line 3.
